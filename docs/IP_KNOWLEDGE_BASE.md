## 1. OVERVIEW OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY TYPES

### What is Intellectual Property?
Intellectual Property (IP) refers to creations of the mind that have commercial value and can be legally protected. For startups, IP is often their most valuable asset and can be critical for:
- Attracting investors
- Preventing competitors from copying
- Creating licensing revenue
- Building company valuation
- Establishing market position

### The Four Main Types of IP

| Type | What It Protects | Duration | Registration Required? |
|------|------------------|----------|----------------------|
| **Trademark** | Brand names, logos, slogans | Indefinite (with renewal) | Recommended |
| **Patent** | Inventions, processes, methods | 20 years | Required |
| **Copyright** | Creative works, code, content | Life + 70 years | Automatic (registration optional) |
| **Trade Secret** | Confidential business information | Indefinite (while secret) | No |

### Why Startups Need IP Protection

1. **Investor Due Diligence**: VCs and angels check IP ownership before investing
2. **Competitive Moat**: Prevents competitors from copying your innovations
3. **Licensing Revenue**: IP can be licensed for royalties
4. **Exit Value**: Strong IP portfolio increases acquisition price
5. **Legal Defense**: Provides legal recourse against infringers

---

## 2. TRADEMARKS - BRAND PROTECTION

### What Trademarks Protect
Trademarks protect brand identifiers that distinguish your goods/services from others:
- **Word marks**: Company names, product names (e.g., "Google", "iPhone")
- **Logo marks**: Visual designs and symbols
- **Slogans/taglines**: Phrases associated with your brand (e.g., "Just Do It")
- **Trade dress**: Distinctive packaging or product appearance
- **Sound marks**: Audio identifiers (e.g., Intel chime)
- **Color marks**: Specific colors associated with brand (rare, hard to get)

### Trademark Classes
Trademarks are registered in specific "classes" of goods/services. There are 45 classes total:
- **Class 9**: Software, apps, computer programs, downloadable content
- **Class 35**: Business services, advertising, retail services
- **Class 38**: Telecommunications, internet services
- **Class 41**: Education, entertainment, training services
- **Class 42**: SaaS, cloud computing, technology services

**Important**: You must register in each relevant class. A trademark in Class 9 doesn't protect you in Class 42.

### Trademark Strength Hierarchy (Strongest to Weakest)

1. **Fanciful**: Made-up words (Xerox, Kodak, Google) - STRONGEST
2. **Arbitrary**: Real words unrelated to product (Apple for computers)
3. **Suggestive**: Hints at product quality (Netflix, Pinterest)
4. **Descriptive**: Describes the product (Bank of America) - Requires secondary meaning
5. **Generic**: Common name for product (Computer, Email) - CANNOT BE TRADEMARKED

### Discovery Questions for Trademarks

Ask founders:
- What is your company name? Have you searched if it's already trademarked?
- What is your product/app name?
- Do you have a logo? Who designed it?
- Do you have any taglines or slogans you use in marketing?
- What countries do you plan to operate in?
- Are you using the name already in commerce (selling products/services)?

### Red Flags to Watch For
- Name is too descriptive of what the product does
- Similar names exist in the same industry
- Using someone else's trademark in their name
- No trademark search conducted before launch
- Logo was designed by contractor without IP assignment

### Trademark Process & Timeline

**United States (USPTO)**:
1. Trademark search (1-2 weeks)
2. File application ($250-350 per class)
3. Examination period (3-4 months)
4. Publication for opposition (30 days)
5. Registration (if no opposition) (3-4 months)
- **Total: 8-12 months**

**Australia (IP Australia)**:
1. Trademark search (1-2 weeks)
2. File application (AUD $250 per class)
3. Examination (4-5 months)
4. Acceptance and advertisement (2 months)
5. Registration
- **Total: 7-8 months**

### Trademark Costs Reference

| Service | DIY Cost | With Attorney |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| US Federal Registration | $250-350/class | $1,000-2,500 |
| State Registration | $50-150 | $300-500 |
| Australia Registration | AUD $250/class | AUD $1,500-3,000 |
| International (Madrid Protocol) | Varies by country | $3,000-10,000+ |

## 3. PATENTS - INVENTION PROTECTION

### What Patents Protect
Patents protect new, useful, and non-obvious inventions:
- **Utility Patents**: New processes, machines, compositions, improvements
- **Design Patents**: Ornamental design of functional items
- **Plant Patents**: New plant varieties (rare for tech startups)

### Patentability Requirements

For an invention to be patentable, it must be:

1. **Novel**: Not already known or used by others
2. **Non-obvious**: Not an obvious improvement to someone skilled in the field
3. **Useful**: Has a practical application
4. **Patentable subject matter**: Not abstract ideas, laws of nature, or natural phenomena

### What CAN Be Patented (Tech Startups)
- Novel algorithms with technical application
- Unique data processing methods
- Hardware innovations
- User interface methods (harder after Alice ruling)
- Machine learning model architectures
- Unique technical solutions to problems

### What CANNOT Be Patented
- Abstract ideas
- Mathematical formulas alone
- Laws of nature
- Natural phenomena
- Mere business methods (without technical implementation)
- Software that only performs generic computer functions

### CRITICAL: The Patent Clock

**The 12-Month Grace Period (US)**:
- In the US, you have 12 months from your first public disclosure to file a patent
- Public disclosure includes: launching a product, publishing about it, presenting at conferences, posting on social media, demo days
- After 12 months, your invention becomes prior art against yourself

**No Grace Period (Most Other Countries)**:
- In most countries (EU, China, Japan), there is NO grace period
- Any public disclosure BEFORE filing destroys patentability
- This is why many companies file before launch

### Discovery Questions for Patents

Ask founders:
- What makes your technology unique? What problem does it solve differently?
- Have you invented any new algorithms, processes, or methods?
- **CRITICAL**: When did you first publicly disclose your invention? (Demo day, launch, blog post, conference)
- Has anyone else solved this problem the same way?
- Who invented it? Was it employees, contractors, or co-founders?
- Have you done a prior art search?

### Red Flags to Watch For
- Public disclosure more than 11 months ago (urgent!)
- Invention was created by contractors without IP assignment
- Similar patents already exist
- Invention is a business method without technical implementation
- Co-inventor disputes

### Patent Process & Timeline

**Provisional Patent (US)**:
- Establishes priority date
- 12 months to file full (non-provisional) patent
- Lower cost, less formal requirements
- Cost: $1,500-5,000 with attorney

**Non-Provisional Patent (US)**:
1. File application ($1,600 small entity)
2. Examination (18-24 months wait)
3. Office actions (respond to examiner objections)
4. Allowance or appeal
5. Issue fee and publication
- **Total: 2-4 years**

**PCT (International)**:
- Single application covers 150+ countries
- Delays national phase costs by 30 months
- Cost: $3,000-10,000 initial

### Patent Costs Reference

| Stage | Small Entity | With Attorney |
|-------|--------------|---------------|
| Provisional Patent | $800 | $2,000-5,000 |
| Non-Provisional | $1,600 | $8,000-15,000 |
| PCT Application | $2,500 | $5,000-10,000 |
| National Phase (per country) | Varies | $3,000-8,000 each |
| Maintenance Fees (over 20 years) | $5,000+ | - |

## 4. COPYRIGHT - CREATIVE WORK PROTECTION

### What Copyright Protects
Copyright automatically protects original creative works:
- **Source code**: All original code is copyrighted
- **Documentation**: User manuals, API docs, guides
- **Content**: Blog posts, marketing copy, videos
- **Designs**: UI/UX designs, graphics, icons
- **Databases**: Original database structures (not the data itself)
- **Music/Audio**: Any original audio content

### Copyright Is Automatic
- Copyright exists the moment a work is created and fixed in tangible form
- No registration required for basic protection
- However, registration provides additional benefits

### Benefits of Copyright Registration

**United States**:
- Required before filing lawsuit for infringement
- Enables statutory damages ($750-$150,000 per work)
- Enables attorney fee recovery
- Creates public record of ownership

**Australia**:
- No registration system exists
- Copyright is automatic upon creation
- Keep records of creation date

### Work Made for Hire
Critical concept for startups:
- If an employee creates work within scope of employment, employer owns copyright
- If a contractor creates work, the CONTRACTOR owns copyright unless assigned
- Always get written IP assignment from contractors

### Discovery Questions for Copyright

Ask founders:
- Who wrote your code? Employees, contractors, or co-founders?
- Do you have written IP assignments from everyone who contributed code?
- Are you using any open-source software? Which licenses?
- Do you have original designs? Who created them?
- Have you copied any code, designs, or content from elsewhere?

### Red Flags to Watch For
- Code written by contractors without IP assignment
- Using copyleft open-source licenses (GPL) in proprietary software
- Copied code or designs from other sources
- No documentation of who created what and when
- Former employees who may claim ownership

### Open Source License Considerations

**Permissive Licenses (Generally Safe)**:
- MIT License
- Apache 2.0
- BSD Licenses
- Can usually be used in proprietary software

**Copyleft Licenses (Caution Required)**:
- GPL (GNU General Public License) - Requires derivative works to also be GPL
- LGPL - Less restrictive, allows linking
- AGPL - Applies to network use, very restrictive

**What to tell founders**: Always keep a list of all open-source components and their licenses. Some investors will require this for due diligence.

## 5. TRADE SECRETS - CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

### What Trade Secrets Protect
Trade secrets protect confidential business information that derives value from being secret:
- Algorithms and formulas
- Customer lists and data
- Business strategies and plans
- Pricing information
- Manufacturing processes
- Supplier information
- Marketing strategies

### Requirements for Trade Secret Protection

Information qualifies as a trade secret if:
1. It is not generally known or readily ascertainable
2. It derives economic value from being secret
3. Reasonable efforts are made to maintain secrecy

### Reasonable Efforts to Maintain Secrecy

Founders must demonstrate they actively protect secrets:
- **NDAs**: Use with employees, contractors, partners, investors
- **Access controls**: Limit who can see sensitive information
- **Physical security**: Locked offices, secure servers
- **Digital security**: Encryption, access logs, password policies
- **Employee training**: Inform staff what is confidential
- **Exit procedures**: Remind departing employees of obligations
- **Marking documents**: Label confidential materials

### Trade Secret vs Patent Decision

| Factor | Choose Trade Secret | Choose Patent |
|--------|--------------------| --------------|
| Can it be reverse-engineered? | No | Yes |
| Is the industry fast-moving? | Yes | No |
| How long is competitive advantage? | Long-term | 20 years max |
| Can you maintain secrecy? | Yes | Doesn't matter |
| Cost tolerance | Low | High |

Famous trade secrets: Coca-Cola formula, Google search algorithm, KFC recipe

### Discovery Questions for Trade Secrets

Ask founders:
- What confidential information gives you competitive advantage?
- Could competitors figure out your methods by using your product?
- Do you have NDAs in place with employees and contractors?
- Who has access to your most sensitive information?
- What security measures protect your confidential data?

---

## 6. DOMAIN NAMES & DIGITAL ASSETS

### Domain Name Strategy

**Primary Domain**:
- Secure exact-match .com if possible
- Consider .co, .io for tech startups
- Country-specific TLDs for local businesses (.com.au, .co.uk)

**Defensive Registrations**:
- Common misspellings
- Plural/singular variations
- Hyphenated versions
- Alternative TLDs (.net, .org, .co)

**Costs**:
- Standard registration: $10-20/year
- Premium domains: $100-$100,000+
- Consider domain monitoring services

### Social Media Handles

Secure consistent handles across:
- Twitter/X
- Instagram
- LinkedIn (company page)
- Facebook
- TikTok
- YouTube
- GitHub
- Product Hunt

**Tip**: Use a service like Namechk to check availability across platforms.

### App Store Presence

- iOS App Store developer name
- Google Play developer name
- Consistent branding across stores

### Discovery Questions for Digital Assets

Ask founders:
- What domain names have you registered?
- Have you secured common misspellings and variations?
- Are your social media handles consistent across platforms?
- Have you registered your app name in app stores?
- Is anyone else using similar names online?

---

## 7. IP OWNERSHIP & ASSIGNMENTS

### The Golden Rule
**If you didn't create it yourself, get it in writing.**

### Founder IP Assignment

All founders should sign an IP assignment agreement that:
- Assigns all prior relevant IP to the company
- Assigns all future IP created for the company
- Includes representations that they have the right to assign
- Is signed BEFORE or AT incorporation

### Employee IP

**Work Made for Hire Doctrine**:
- In the US, employer automatically owns work created by employees within scope of employment
- Still best practice to have written agreement
- Include invention assignment in employment contract

**Employee IP Agreements Should Include**:
- Assignment of all work-related inventions
- Definition of confidential information
- Non-compete (where enforceable)
- Non-solicitation
- Return of company property on termination

### Contractor IP

**CRITICAL**: By default, contractors OWN their work.

**Every contractor agreement must include**:
- IP assignment clause
- Work-for-hire language
- Waiver of moral rights
- Representation that work is original
- Indemnification for IP claims

**Get assignments BEFORE paying final invoice** - leverage is important.

### Prior Inventions

Employees/contractors may have prior inventions they want to exclude:
- Document all prior inventions in writing at hiring
- Be specific about what's excluded
- Ensure prior inventions don't conflict with company work

### Discovery Questions for IP Ownership

Ask founders:
- How many founders are there? Have all founders signed IP assignment?
- Have you used any contractors? Do you have IP assignments from all of them?
- Do employees sign IP assignment agreements?
- Did any founder bring prior IP into the company?
- Were any key features developed before the company was formed?
- Has anyone left the company who contributed to the product?

### Red Flags to Watch For
- No written IP assignments from founders
- Contractors paid without IP assignment
- Key features developed before incorporation
- Departing employees without proper documentation
- Former employers who might claim IP

---

## 8. CONTRACTS & AGREEMENTS

### Essential Startup Contracts for IP Protection

**1. Founder Agreement / Shareholder Agreement**
- IP assignment provisions
- Vesting schedules
- Departure terms
- Decision-making authority

**2. Employee Offer Letter / Employment Agreement**
- IP assignment
- Confidentiality obligations
- Non-compete (where legal)
- Non-solicitation

**3. Contractor Agreement / Consulting Agreement**
- Scope of work
- IP assignment (explicit)
- Work-for-hire language
- Confidentiality
- Indemnification

**4. Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)**
- Definition of confidential information
- Permitted uses
- Duration of obligations
- Return/destruction of information
- Carve-outs for public information

**5. Terms of Service / EULA**
- License grant to users
- IP ownership statement
- User restrictions
- Limitation of liability

**6. Privacy Policy**
- Data collection practices
- Data ownership
- Third-party sharing
- User rights

### When to Use NDAs

**Do use NDAs with**:
- Contractors before discussing project details
- Partners in business discussions
- Potential acquirers in due diligence
- Employees (in employment agreement)

**Don't expect NDAs from**:
- Venture capitalists (most won't sign)
- Accelerators
- Journalists
- Large potential customers (during sales)

**Tip**: If someone won't sign an NDA, don't share your true trade secrets. Only share what's necessary.

### Discovery Questions for Contracts

Ask founders:
- Do you have a formal founder agreement with IP provisions?
- Do all employees sign confidentiality and IP assignment agreements?
- Do you have a standard contractor agreement with IP assignment?
- Do you have NDA templates ready for sensitive discussions?
- Have you reviewed your Terms of Service for IP provisions?

## 9. INTERNATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

### Territorial Nature of IP

IP rights are territorial - they only apply in countries where registered/protected:
- A US trademark doesn't protect you in Australia
- A US patent doesn't prevent infringement in China
- Copyright is more universal but enforcement varies

### Priority Filing Windows

**Paris Convention Priority**:
- File in one country, have 6 months (trademarks) or 12 months (patents) to file in other member countries
- Later filings get the priority date of the first filing
- Critical for maintaining priority across countries

**Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT)**:
- Single international patent application
- Covers 150+ countries
- Delays national phase decisions by 30 months
- Doesn't result in an "international patent" - must enter national phase

**Madrid Protocol (Trademarks)**:
- International trademark registration system
- File one application, designate multiple countries
- Managed through WIPO

### Key Markets for Startups

**Primary Markets** (File first):
- United States - Largest market
- European Union - Single market of 27 countries
- Australia - If operating locally

**Secondary Markets** (Consider based on business):
- United Kingdom - Post-Brexit, separate from EU
- Canada - Close to US market
- China - Manufacturing, large consumer market
- India - Growing tech market
- Japan - Tech innovation hub

### Discovery Questions for International

Ask founders:
- Where are your customers located?
- Where are your competitors based?
- Do you plan to expand internationally? Which markets?
- Are you manufacturing or sourcing from other countries?
- Have you filed any applications internationally?

---

## 10. STAGE-BASED IP STRATEGY

### Idea Stage

**Priority Actions**:
- Document your idea (dated records)
- Do basic trademark availability search
- Keep ideas confidential
- Use NDAs with people you discuss with

**Don't**:
- Spend money on registrations yet
- Publicly disclose innovations
- Assume verbal agreements are enough

### Building / Pre-Launch

**Priority Actions**:
- Secure domain name
- File trademark applications
- Get IP assignments from all contributors
- If patentable innovation exists, consider provisional patent
- Set up contractor agreements with IP provisions

**Key Questions**:
- Have you publicly disclosed anything? (Starts patent clock)
- Is the name available as trademark?
- Who has contributed and do you have assignments?

### MVP / Beta Launch

**Priority Actions**:
- This is public disclosure - patent clock starts now
- Finalize trademark filings before launch
- Register copyright for key software (US)
- Establish trade secret protocols
- Review Terms of Service

**Critical**: Any unique technical innovations must be filed for patent BEFORE this stage in most countries.

### Post-Launch / Growth

**Priority Actions**:
- Monitor for trademark infringement
- Consider international filings
- Document all evidence of use
- Continue securing IP assignments
- Consider design patents for UI elements
- Review and strengthen trade secret protection

### Scale / Pre-Investment

**Priority Actions**:
- Audit all IP ownership documentation
- Ensure clean chain of title
- File any outstanding registrations
- Prepare IP summary for due diligence
- Consider freedom-to-operate analysis

## 11. COMMON FOUNDER MISTAKES

### Trademark Mistakes

1. **Not searching before naming**: Discovering conflicts after launch is expensive
2. **Choosing descriptive names**: "Best AI Writing Tool" cannot be trademarked
3. **Not registering**: "Common law" rights are weak and limited geographically
4. **Wrong classes**: Registering in Class 9 when you need Class 42
5. **Not using ® or ™**: Reduces damages in infringement cases
6. **Letting registrations lapse**: Trademarks require maintenance

### Patent Mistakes

1. **Disclosing before filing**: Kills international patent rights, starts US clock
2. **Waiting too long**: Missing the 12-month window
3. **Not documenting invention**: Need dated records of conception
4. **Assuming software can't be patented**: It can, with proper framing
5. **Not doing prior art search**: Wasting money on unpatentable inventions
6. **Provisional and forgetting**: Must file non-provisional within 12 months

### Copyright Mistakes

1. **No contractor IP assignments**: Contractor owns the work by default
2. **Ignoring open source licenses**: GPL violations can be serious
3. **Not registering in US**: Can't sue for infringement without registration
4. **Copying without permission**: Even "inspired by" can be infringement
5. **No records of creation**: Hard to prove ownership later

### Trade Secret Mistakes

1. **No NDAs**: Can't claim it's secret if you didn't try to protect it
2. **Too broad access**: Limit who knows sensitive information
3. **No confidentiality marking**: Label documents as confidential
4. **Sharing with investors without NDA**: VCs often won't sign, so don't share true secrets
5. **No exit procedures**: Remind departing employees of obligations

### Ownership Mistakes

1. **Verbal agreements with co-founders**: Always get IP assignment in writing
2. **Paying contractors without IP assignment**: Do assignment BEFORE final payment
3. **No employee IP agreements**: Even where work-for-hire applies
4. **IP created before company formed**: Need assignment of prior work
5. **Not tracking contributors**: Every person who contributed needs documentation
